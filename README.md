*Figure: Example Points*
  
## Description

Design an application that, given a set of coordinates [(x1,y1), .., (xn, yn)], determines:

- the two closest points between each other
- the two most distant points between each other

User your knowledge of **Clean and Maintainable Code** to create an **application with automated tests**.

Start with tests or implementation, whatever is better for you.

## Bonus

- determine all points for the closest and farthermost distance
- use JUnit5 as test framework
